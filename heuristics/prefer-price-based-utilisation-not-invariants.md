# Prefer price based utilisation not invariants

## Question
What should I look in my software procurement process?

## Heuristic
Prefer price based utilisation not invariants.

## Examples
- A new version for a specific customer, that can be roll-out as feature for other customer (mainly thinking about usage of serverless)
- Use serverless vs use VM (provisioned capacity)
- Use a SaaS solution that is per item/transaction/etc. based
